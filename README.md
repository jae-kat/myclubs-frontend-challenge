# ðŸŒŸ myClubs Frontend Challenge 

Hi! Weâ€™re happy to see you are interested in joining the myClubs team. ðŸ™Œ

This is a small challenge to get a feeling for your frontend dev style and skills. You should invest no more than 2-5 hours in completing it and these instructions contain all the information you need. Everything else is up to your own judgement. There is no right or wrong solution, only your personal approach.

## ðŸš€ What You Should Create

Imagine one of our users that is looking for the perfect next workout. Create an interface for that use-case that displays sports activities and add the option to book a workout (UI only, no network requests necessary). Show a confirmation that the booking was successful when the user books a workout.

Your app should fetch and use the data for the sports activities from this endpoint:

```
https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev-challenges.myclubs.com/frontend/frontend_challenge_activities.json
```

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverable

Donâ€™t be afraid to use easy/convenient solutions. We are as much interested in your reasoning as we are in the result. You can ask questions at any time.

* Use [React](https://reactjs.org/) and feel free to use any further package/library/tool/â€¦ that you like. 
  * hint: using [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) is a good starting point.
* Make it responsive.
* Make it look nice. Itâ€™s okay to copy style from our website & apps.

Use this repository as a template. Once you are done send us the URL of your public repository or alternatively invite @lukasnagl to your private repository. 
One should be able to run your solution by cloning your repository and executing:

```
npm install
npm start
```
